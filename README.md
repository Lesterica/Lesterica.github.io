Front-end Challenges

- Integrating new information
- Choosing a better color scheme than previous UI mockup
- Getting the bus picture to show up
- Limited knowledge for aligning things. Feels like it should be more clean and straightforward
- Limited knowledge for how to evenly spacing items


Front-end Delights

- It was easier than expected to add icons and fonts from font awesome and google fonts
- I enjoyed finally finding a color scheme that looks modern and not overwhelming 
- Implementing my ideas and seeing it change in real time
